Ways to check for outliers:
- scatter plots
- checking their zscore with stats.zscore()

NaN values:
- fill with suitable value for each column
- drop columns which mostly are NaN values

Feature engineering:
- 'total<things>' from various features like (floor bathrooms and basement bathrooms) //you can drop columns after//


Check correlation:
- if two features are highly correlated, you can drop one (the least correlated with the target or the rest of features)
